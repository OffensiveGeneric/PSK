# PSK
Perchance KSK addon

## Goal
To have an addon that records guild member standings in regards to the KSK raid loot system.  The addon should do the following (in no particular order):

- List all guild members who are at max level
  - Differentiate between online, online and in raid, and offline.
  - Show class icons to the left of the player frame.
  - Show "Last Seen" to know when a player was last active.
- Store guild member standing (position) in a persistent DB
  - Sort all members by standing
  - Allow for moving a guild member to the bottom of the list when receiving an item.
- Initiate a "bidding window" that expires after a set time.
- Record all bids and display bids in the raid chat when the bidding window closes.
- Report current standings to raid or guild.
